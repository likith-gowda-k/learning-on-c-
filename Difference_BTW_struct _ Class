Struct  are value type class is refernece type
all difference that are applicable to value types and reference type are applicable to struct and class
structs are stored on stack ,where as classes are stored on heap
value tyoes hold value in memory when declared but reference type hold refernece to an objkect in memory
values types are destoryed immediately after scope is lost where as reference type only loses the reference variable destoryed after scope is lost . the object is later destoryed by garbage collector
when copy of struct is created into another struct modification made in one struct will not affect the other struct
when copy of class is created ,we only get a copy of refernec variable both variables point to same object on heap.so operation on one variable will affect others
struct can't have destructors but class canhave
struct cannot have explicit parameter less constructor
strcut can't inherit from another class where as class can ,both struct and class can inherit from interface
struct cannot inherit from another struct , struct is sealed types
